        # Source https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21142231/group-consecutive-integers-and-tolerate-gaps-of-1

        The way this works is that the key is the acting as a function because of the call. The call is called on each
        individual item in a list. For the first item, there is no previous item so it takes the none defined in the
        __init__. Otherwise, at the end of each call self.prev is assigned the current value so it is kept in memory.

        The diff is user defined, its the tolerance or maximum distance allowed between items. If set to zero, all items
        are set to there own sub group. The elem is the current element that has been taken for group by. The flag could
        be many things, but is designed to be toggle. When something meets the diff criteria then we want to invert our
        flag so we create the separation.

        Example

        Lets say i have a list of the following [1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10] and i want to group them with a tolerance of 1
        The group-by instance that will call this method is for loop or sorts. So the elem is 1, self.prev has not yet
        been re-defined so it is None and we add this element to our sub group with a given flag. The next element 2 is
        then brought in and now we have a previous element to compare to. We check our condition of self.prev - elem
        and we get a value of 1. 1 is not greater than the tolerance we set of 1 so we add this to our sub list and
        update the self.prev to 2. Then we bring in the next element of 5, here 5 - 2 is greater than 1 so we want to
        change the flag.

        The changes of the flag means we end up with a list of 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0. Group-by then uses these keys to group
        the individual components by the same consecutive elements with the same keys. So this results in the list being
        group currently as [[1, 2], [5, 6], [9, 10]]

        :param elem: The current element from the given list
